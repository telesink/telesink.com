<h1>Know what your product is doing. Right now</h1>

<p>
  Telesink will be an open-source, real-time event tracking tool that acts as
  an informational heartbeat for your business, so you can see what’s happening
  <em>right now</em>.
</p>

<p>
  You’ll be able to hook up your projects and watch live events like:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>“People are signing up”</li>
  <li>“Payments are flowing”</li>
  <li>“MRR is ticking up”</li>
  <li>“New trials are starting”</li>
  <li>“Users are completing onboarding”</li>
  <li>“Form submissions are coming in”</li>
  <li>“Subscribers are renewing”</li>
  <li>...and many more.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Unlike analytical tools that dig into historical data or developer metrics,
  Telesink is simple and real-time-first. It’s built for everyone, a
  straightforward, all-around dashboard for seeing things happen <em>as they
  happen</em>.
</p>

<p>
  It’s a cleaner replacement for those read-only bots in
  <em>Slack</em>, <em>Discord</em>, or <em>Telegram</em> that handle this kind of
  monitoring as an afterthought.
</p>

<p>
  It’ll be <strong>open source and free to self-host</strong>, with a paid SaaS offering
  to sustain development.
