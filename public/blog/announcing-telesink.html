  <h1>Announcing Telesink</h1>

  <p>
    Telesink will be an <a href="https://github.com/telesink">open-source</a>,
    real-time event tracking tool that acts as an informational heartbeat for
    your business, so you can see what’s happening
    <em>right now</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ll be able to hook up your projects and watch live events like:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>“People are signing up”</li>
    <li>“Payments are flowing”</li>
    <li>“MRR is ticking up”</li>
    <li>“New trials are starting”</li>
    <li>“Users are completing onboarding”</li>
    <li>“Form submissions are coming in”</li>
    <li>“Subscribers are renewing”</li>
    <li>...and many more.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Unlike analytical tools that dig into historical data or developer metrics,
    Telesink is simple and real-time-first. It’s built for everyone, a
    straightforward, all-around dashboard for seeing things happen
    <em>as they happen</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s a cleaner replacement for those read-only bots in
    <a href="https://slack.com"><em>Slack</em></a>, <a
    href="https://discord.com"><em>Discord</em></a>, or <a
    href="https://telegram.org"><em>Telegram</em></a> that handle this kind of
    monitoring as an afterthought.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’ll be <strong>open source (<a href="/license">license</a>) and free to self-host</strong>, with a paid
    SaaS offering to sustain development.
